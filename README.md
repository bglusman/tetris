Cross Platform Tetris
=====================

This is a toy implementation of Tetris, with all
the game logic in pure ruby, that runs both locally
on the desktop, using Ruby's [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/) project,
and in the browser, using [Opal.rb](http://opalrb.org/) and [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
(via the [React.rb](https://github.com/zetachang/react.rb/) wrapper)
